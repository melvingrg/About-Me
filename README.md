# About-Me
## Hi :wave:

I am an engineer turned Technical Writer :page_with_curl: and Scrum Master :chart_with_upwards_trend: with a knack for storytelling :stars:. 
My passion lies in driving customer success through clear and concise requirement gathering and documentation. With a strong enthusiasm for product improvements and customer satisfaction, I bring clarity to requirements, leading to better products.

What I do:

- Craft comprehensive product release documents, user guides, release notes, API guides, FAQs, and user stories.
- Lead sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, and backlog refinement.
- Baby steps in coding: C# and Python.

I believe that clear requirements are the foundation of successful products. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence, I aim to provide superior vision and clarity in product roadmaps and documentation, helping to reduce technical debt and ensure continuous improvement.
